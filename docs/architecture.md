# Velvet Glove runner design

The runner owns tool selection, recursive file discovery, Pkl policy, execution,
classification, diagnostics artifacts, and the `RunnerDomainOutcome` semantic
result. Core, native, common, and runtime crates do not depend on those policies.

Per-harness lowering is intentionally explicit. The aligned runtime preserves a
lossless Claude, Codex, or Antigravity input arm; runner-local policy
discovers paths from that exact value; and the runner constructs the
corresponding native output arm. No generic output envelope or universal
lowering layer participates.
Antigravity `PostToolUse` includes the originating tool call, so the runner can
derive call-scoped file candidates from its name and arguments. It still has no
tool result or changed-file list, and its empty output object cannot carry user
or agent messages. Strict lowering rejects those messages and best-effort omits
them. Best-effort-with-warnings writes a versioned, collision-safe JSON loss
record beneath the event's exact `artifactDirectoryPath`, then uses successful
protocol stderr to point to that record while preserving exact `{}` stdout.
Failure to persist the record fails the hook instead of silently dropping it.

The runtime context supplies exact harness, snapshot, event, and contract identity
plus only context fields declared by the native event. Operational diagnostics are
kept out of protocol stdout; user-visible stderr is emitted only through an exact
native output, while verbose remaining-tool output belongs in runner artifacts.

To add a tool, extend the Pkl catalog and its fake-executable orchestration cases;
real-tool fixtures belong to the opt-in compatibility lane. To add a harness,
first prove how its native event yields changed files, then add an explicit final
lowering arm and exact native fixture tests.

Performance budgets are not yet release guarantees. The hermetic smoke lane checks
behavior but does not currently record startup, clean no-op, or subprocess timing;
add a dedicated benchmark/measurement lane before publishing performance claims.

## Turn-completion batching

`velvet-glove turn-completion` reuses the same Pkl catalog and execution engine,
but obtains candidate files from the `hookkit-file-activity` pending entity
maintained by `velvet-glove post-tool`. That quiet aligned
PostToolUse observer delegates structured, patch, and shell analysis to
`hookkit-file-activity::observe_post_tool` and the shared tool-access layer.
The immediate runner uses the same observation path for exact file candidates
instead of maintaining a second open-payload walker. Before taking the entity view, it
reconciles workspace mtimes from the prior durable cursor, using current-session
start metadata only as the first lower bound. The aligned lifecycle is Claude,
Codex, or Antigravity Stop. Antigravity lacks a precise session-start
producer but its PostToolUse tool-call evidence can feed the tracker directly.

One runner-family advisory lock serializes stop attempts for a native session.
The consumer seals NDJSON generations and obtains their cached set projection
before executing tools. Stop-time `workflows` are distinct from the immediate
runner's legacy `phases`: all non-mutating initial checks run first, only dirty
workflows receive one ordered remedy, and snapshot-discovered writes invalidate
intersecting target-file or workspace checks for one authoritative final sweep.
Check stages retain bounded job parallelism and deterministic result ordering.
The complex deferred policy is split across `deferred/model.rs`,
`deferred/execution.rs`, `deferred/reporting.rs`, and `deferred/lowering.rs`;
the main module retains CLI, state transaction, artifact, and immediate-runner
orchestration so the two product paths share conversion and process plumbing.

When a builtin has no explicit `workflows`, catalog validation proves its
compatibility translation has a read-only final phase before it can ship as
enabled. The generated
[`builtin-deferred-workflow-audit.md`](builtin-deferred-workflow-audit.md)
records every command, inferred or explicit scope, invocation granularity, and
known limitation. Immediate PostToolUse continues to use legacy `phases`.

Every executed deferred command writes its own artifact under a deterministic
tool/workflow/job/phase path in a unique run bundle. Artifact metadata includes
structured argv, working directory, candidate and changed files, exit code,
classification, full output, and its report identity. One report/artifact can
therefore be linked by every conservatively attributed file, while a file
covered by several tools retains all distinct links.

The runner commits `summary.json` only after every command artifact is durable
and before changing pending state. The summary contains run identity, counts,
normal buckets, current groups, artifact paths and a separate path-to-contents
map, the complete result model, rendered-message metadata, and the planned
source disposition. The runner then appends stable retry evidence for only
manual, operationally incomplete, and unresolved work, records content-based
handled baselines for discharged work, and acknowledges the sealed source
generations. New observations written during execution are outside the snapshot
and remain pending independently. Mtime and opt-in Git-dirty reconciliation
suppress only fingerprints that still match a handled baseline; direct
observations always requeue the path.

Coverage gaps use the Pkl `fileActivity.coverageGapPolicy`. The default
`best-effort` policy retains and summarizes incomplete targets without treating
resolved clean files as manual. `strict` also blocks Stop until the gap clears.
Recursive target expansion is bounded by `fileActivity.maxEntries`; exhaustion
is both summarized and requeued. Batch/workspace findings are conservatively
attributed to all job candidates, while byte snapshots preserve exact files
actually changed by remedies.

### Exact Stop lowering

Rendered deferred messages are lowered without a common output envelope. The
capability matrix is:

| Native event | Allowed user | Allowed agent | Blocked user | Blocked agent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Stop | `systemMessage` | `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` | `systemMessage` | `reason` and `additionalContext` |
| Codex Stop | `systemMessage` | unavailable | `systemMessage` | `reason` |
| Antigravity Stop | unavailable | unavailable | unavailable | `reason` |

`loweringPolicy = "strict"` turns any nonempty unavailable audience into a
hook failure after committing the summary but before changing pending state.
`"best-effort"` omits that audience. `"best-effort-with-warnings"` also emits
an omission warning through `systemMessage` when available; Antigravity can
only use its single `reason` fallback and cannot preserve audience separation.
The summary records emitted, omitted, empty, or unrepresentable status for
each audience. Allowed completion stays allowed under both best-effort modes.
